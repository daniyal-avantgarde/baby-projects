# Price tracker

This program is for when you want to buy something at the cheapest price. You input the URL of the product you'd like to buy.

I'd probably want a chart of the product's price over the last month/year, to know the minimum price the product has gone for. Alternatively I should be able to fix a minimum price - I will not pay more than this for this, regardless of how stupid my proposed price is and whether the market will ever actually offer the product at that price. The program should also show me the current going price for the product i.e., current market valuation.
